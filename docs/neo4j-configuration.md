# How to write the Neo4J configuration

The configuration file always start with the following line: `[NEO4J]`.

After that, the file looks like this:

    hostname = somehostname
    protocol = http(s)/bolt
    port = 9999
    user = username_for_your_db
    password = pw_for_that_user

-   hostname: Hostname of your Neo4J-server (e.g. localhost or some
    remote hostname)
-   protocol: One of http, https or bolt
-   port: 7474 is default for http(s), 7687 is default for bolt. You can
    put a custom port here, but make sure your database is reachable
    through that port
-   user: username to access the db
-   password: password for the specified user
